# mi_card

A mini project that shows user's personal card. For this project, I used Educaree informartion. Educaree is a starting company which I work on, and it made me excited to its card, even though it is not an official app.

## Getting Started

To run this app, everything you have to do is to clone it, open it on an IDE (I recommend Android Studio) and get the dependencies (aka assets). Then, compile it either into your phone or into the virtual phone provided by Android Studio. That's it! Educaree's card is ready to be displayed.
